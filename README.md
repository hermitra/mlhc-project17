This is the repository for our MLHC class project on genetics-based prediction of transcriptional subtypes in Alzheimerâ€™s disease
## Overview of the project
Our study employs a pre-trained model from SHEPHERD, a deep learning algorithm developed by the Zitnik Lab at Harvard Medical School, to facilitate the elucidation of the causal relationship between transcriptional hallmark gene candidates of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and their associated phenotypes, through leveraging an external rare disease knowledge graph. Two rounds of prediction are conducted, with the second round incorporating GWAS-analysis information obtained with plink2.

The outputs from SHEPHERD are then subject to analysis by APRILE, GOA and ChatGPT's natural language processing capabilities, in conjunction with literature reviews, to extract biological insights and assess the potential of repurposing drugs currently used for rare neurological disorders, to treat AD. Our study provides a comprehensive approach to exploring potential drug repurposing for AD, utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and external data sources. All relevant code can be found on our GitHub respository. For reproducible results, follow the guideline below.
